## Summary:
The analysis table and trend line chart indicates a possible strategy shift driver's area of coverage with a few hundred Urban drivers covering into Suburban area which should help increase Total Rides due to more drivers available along with Total Fares increased. The area coverage shift will bring the Average Fare per Ride down for customers will allow suburban riders use the ride-share program due to competive pricing. Urabn Average Fare per Ride will increase for riders along with Urban Average Fare per Driver. The outcome would hopefully demonstrate adding more coverage for suburban area and bring in new customers for increase profits.
